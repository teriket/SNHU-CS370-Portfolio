# SNHU-CS370-Portfolio
The final portfolio piece for SNHU's CS370 Current / Emerging Trends in Computer Science

## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
    This project is a neural network that navigates a maze, designed for a hypothetical gaming company.  I was given code for the environment the game runs in, a class that stores experiences for the neural network, and the neural network itself.  I wrote the deep Q-learning code that trained the neural network.
    
## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
  

## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
    Computer scientists consult, design, and build algorithmic solutions to computational problems.  This is important because this code bridges the gap between people and technology.  In doing so, computer scientists create technologies that serve individuals, businesses, communities, and the world.

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
    

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
