# SNHU-CS370-Portfolio
The final portfolio piece for SNHU's CS370 Current / Emerging Trends in Computer Science

## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
This project is a neural network that navigates a maze, designed for a hypothetical gaming company.  I was given code for the environment the game runs in, a class that stores experiences for the neural network, and the neural network itself.  I wrote the deep Q-learning code that trained the neural network.
    
## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
This course connects to the larger field of computer science in a couple of ways.  Most prominently, it covers emerging topics in computer science, which gives me in-demand skills.  Another major theme in this course was topics that have been persistent themes in computer science, like the ethical responsibilities of software engineers, laws around software development, and backing design decisions with well-founded research. 

## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists consult, design, and build algorithmic solutions to computational problems.  This is important because this code bridges the gap between people and technology.  In doing so, computer scientists create technologies that serve individuals, businesses, communities, and the world.

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
There are multiple steps to solving a problem as a computer scientist.  I need to identify the stakeholders in a problem, thuroughly define the problem, identify security legal and ethical concerns, then come to a concensus about what an acceptible solution would be.  I then evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of multiple designs to find a solution that best fits stakeholder requirements.  I then build and iterate on the proposed solution, using stakeholder feedback along the way.

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
Everyone is a stakeholder in computer science and my ethical responsibilities reflect that.  Users should be given a product that fulfills their needs, promotes collaborative decision making, is transparent, and upholds user privacy and human dignity.  My actions should reflect positively on my employing organization by producing high quality, secure products.
